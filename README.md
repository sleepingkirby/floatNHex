# floatNHex
#Usage: floatNHex.pl &#60;hex or float&#62;
#Uses perl's pack and unpack to calculate. Not meant for highly scientific accuracy.
#Doesn't handle scientific notation (i.e. 1.23e5) 
#Because I'm tired of doing it manually and there's no offline calc app that'll do it.

#done really quickly so not the best code structure.
