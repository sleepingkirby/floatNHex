# floatNHex
Usage: floatNHex.pl <hex or float>
Uses perl's pack and unpack to calculate. Not meant for highly scientific accuracy.
Doesn't handle scientific notation (i.e. 1.23e5) 
Because I'm tired of doing it manually and there's no offline calc app that'll do it.

done really quickly so not the best code structure.
